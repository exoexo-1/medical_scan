The actions continued immediately after the occlusions with either coherent or incoherent timing. In time-coherent trials, the action continuation corresponded to the occluder duration (i.e., the action continued 1 s after the last frame before occlusion). In time-incoherent trials, the action either continued at a frame that was too soon (coherent − 500 ms) or belated in the action sequence (coherent + 2000 ms). Participants decided whether the action continued with coherent or incoherent timing, by pressing one of two response buttons with their left index finger. Repetitive TMS was applied only during occlusions in 50% of the trials. TMS application either started at occluder-onset (TMS-early) or 300 ms after occluder-onset (TMS-late). In 50% of the trials (noTMS), performance under unstimulated conditions was assessed. Pulse trains included five single pulses at a frequency of 10 Hz and lasted for 400 ms.

All MRI slices are shown in radiological convention. Volumetric analyses (Philippi et al. 2012) reveal that his lesion encompasses 90 % of the insula, 99 % of the ACC, and 100 % of the amygdala. The lesion extends beyond these regions into other limbic territories with more extensive damage in the right hemisphere. The entire right insula is destroyed and the damage in the posterior sector extends into parietal operculum, secondary somatosensory cortex, and the underlying white matter. The vast majority of the left insula is also destroyed with the exception of a small island of tissue in the left dorsal anterior insula that appears to be functionally disconnected from the rest of the brain (Philippi et al. 2012). Although the ACC has been destroyed bilaterally, the more dorsal and posterior aspects of Brodmann area 32 appear to be spared in the left hemisphere; however, this remaining tissue is dorsal to the paracingulate sulcus, and is therefore considered part of the paracingulate cortex (and not the ACC proper). Of note, Roger’s lesion has largely spared the brainstem, thalamus, and primary and secondary somatosensory cortices.

This can be explained by the smaller deformation required to align individual scans with the unbiased template, and by the different transformation model used in the registration process. The rhesus atlas demonstrates improved contrast and lower noise, as it is based on a larger population (18 versus 10 scans used to create our vervet atlases).","Bottom Line:Our evaluation confirms the consistency and reliability of the automatic segmentation.The comparison of atlas construction strategies reveals that the use of a population-specific atlas leads to improved accuracy of the segmentation for subcortical brain structures.First, we describe an image processing workflow specifically tuned towards the analysis of vervet MRI that consists solely of the open source software tools.",https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/150/57/3256578/PMC3256578_TONIJ-5-186_F3.png

A) An illustration of the Gd-G5-doxorubicin dendrimer. Doxorubicin is conjugated to the dendrimer terminal amines by a pH-sensitive hydrazone bond, which facilitates the rapid release of doxorubicin following particle endocytosis into brain tumor cell lysosomal compartments. B) Annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy image of Gd-G5-doxorubicin dendrimers. C) In vitro fluorescence microscopy of cultured RG-2 glioma cells incubated for 4 hours in media containing Gd-G5-doxorubicin dendrimers at a 600 nM concentration. The red fluorescence in the cytoplasm represents Gd-G5-doxorubicin dendrimers within the cytoplasm of RG-2 glioma cells. The red fluorescence within the RG-2 cell nuclei represents free doxorubicin that has been released from the Gd-G5-doxorubicn dendrimers following cleavage of the hydrazone bond, since particles larger than Gd-G2 dendrimers are too large to pass through the nuclear pores. D) T2-weighted anatomic scan image and T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scan Gd concentration map images at various time points up to 60 minutes following Gd-G5-doxorubicn dendrimer infusion. The Gd-G5-doxorubicin dendrimer was administered intravenously over 2 minutes at a Gd dose of 0.09 mmol Gd/kg, which is equivalent to a doxorubicin dose of 8 mg/kg. The T2-weighted anatomic scan image shows the location of the RG-2 glioma in the right caudate of rat brain, which has a tumor volume of 16 mm3. The first T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scan image displays the lack of contrast enhancement prior to Gd-G5 doxorubicin dendrimer infusion. The second T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scan image confirms contrast enhancement in the vasculature immediately after Gd-G5-doxorubicin dendrimer infusion. The third T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scan image shows that at 60 minutes following the Gd-G5-doxorubicin dendrimer infusion there is significant Gd-G5-doxorubicin accumulation within the RG-2 glioma tumor extravascular extracellular space, which confirms that the Gd-G5-doxorubicin dendrimer has extravasated slowly across the BBTB over timer due to its long blood half-life. The white arrow highlights that there is positive contrast enhancement of normal brain tissue, which indicates that there is extravasation of the Gd-G5-doxorubicin dendrimer across the normal BBB. E) Percent change in RG-2 malignant glioma volume within 24 hours. One group of orthotopic RG-2 glioma bearing animals received one intravenous 8 mg/kg dose of Gd-G5-doxorubicin dendrimer with respect to doxorubicin (n = 7), and the other group of glioma bearing animals received one 8 mg/kg dose of free doxorubicin (n = 7).

image1152.png,"CT, MRI, PET, MR","FU1: We present a 64-year-old man with subacute left-side dominant bilateral choreic movement (diabetic chorea) evaluated using a combination of dopamine transporter SPECT, 18F FDG PET, 99mTc ethylcysteinate dimer (99mTc ECD) SPECT, and 123I metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy. We diagnosed him with diabetic chorea because of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (HbA1c 13%-18%) and brain MRI showing pathognomonic hyperintensity on T1-weighted imaging in the bilateral caudate nucleus and putamen and right-side external segment of the globus pallidus (A). No significant abnormality on T2- (B) and T2*-weighted images (C) was found in the corresponding area. No significant old infarction or other differential diagnoses for chorea were identified.1 Dopamine transporter SPECT showed bilaterally and right-side dominant reduced 123I ioflupane binding in the caudate nucleus and putamen (D). The specific binding ratio2 was 1.22 on the right and 1.36 on the left side (ELEGP was used as a collimator, and no scatter correction or attenuation correction was applied). The asymmetry dopamine transporter SPECT in diabetic chorea index (AI) of ioflupane binding was 10.7%, revealing a decline predominantly on the right side. This was consistent with the contralateral dominance of the chorea. No confounding medication for the evaluation with dopamine transporter SPECT was identified.3 Brain 18F FDG PET revealed decreased glucose metabolism (E) in the corresponding area, similar to the dopamine transporter SPECT, suggesting regional dysfunction in the bilateral striatum. There was no significant left-to-right difference in striatal 18F FDG PET uptake, with an AI of 2.7%. 99mTc ECD SPECT revealed reduced brain perfusion in the bilateral caudate nucleus, putamen, and thalamus (F). 123I MIBG scintigraphy showed no reduction in the H/M ratio, with 4.95 in the early phase and 5.03 in the late phase (G, late phase). We assumed that a low accumulation in the mediastinum caused this high H/M ratio. Treatment with dopamine antagonist and blood glucose control relieved most choreic symptoms within 4 weeks, and we are now successfully reducing his dopamine antagonist dose. Reduced glucose metabolism was found in the bilateral putamen and caudate nucleus in the 18F FDG PET in our patient, suggesting regional striatal dysfunction. This was consistent with earlier studies on diabetic chorea.4–7 Several theories regarding the underlying pathology of diabetic chorea have been proposed, including petechial hemorrhage,7 metabolic abnormality because of hyperglycemia,5,7 patchy striatal necrosis associated with vasculopathy,6 and transient ischemia.7 No conclusion has been reached to date. The only earlier report using dopamine transporter SPECT with hyperglycemic hemichorea-hemiballismus8 revealed decreased 123I ioflupane binding in the striatum as was observed in our case. Cardiac imaging with 123I MIBG scintigraphy in our case revealed normal 123I MIBG uptake by the cardiac sympathetic nerve, suggesting that coexisting Parkinson’s disease, Lewy body disease, diabetic sympathetic nerve dysfunction, or heart failure were unlikely. This suggests nigrostriatal dopaminergic involvement: presynaptic neuronal terminal dysfunction, reduced density of nerve terminals, or reduced density of dopamine transporter is conceivable.8,9","Bottom Line:F FDG PET showed metabolic dysfunction in the bilateral striatum, as shown in earlier studies.Tc ECD SPECT revealed reduced brain perfusion in the bilateral caudate nucleus and putamen.I MIBG scintigraphy revealed no cardiac sympathetic nerve dysfunction.",https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/150/284/4859201/PMC4859201_rlu-41-481-g001.png
